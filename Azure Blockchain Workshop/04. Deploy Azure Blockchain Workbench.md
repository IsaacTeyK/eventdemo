## Exercise 2: Deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench
Duration: 60 - 90 minutes

In this exercise, the student will deploy and setup Azure Blockchain App Builder.

### Task 1: Generate SSH Public / Private Key
1. Run **PuTTY Key Generator** **(puttygen.exe)**:
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>

2. Click **Generate** to begin generating a new public/private key pair, and follow the instructions to move the mouse to generate randomness

3. Click **Save public key** to save the generated Public key to a file

5. Click **Save private key** to save the generated Private Key to a file

8. You can now close PuTTY Key Generator, but remember where the Key files have been saves. They will need needed in a future step.

### Task 2:Deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench
1. Login to the Azure Portal at <http://portal.azure.com> using the credentials for your Azure Pass that you will be using to deploy the resources created within this lab.

2. Click on the **Directory and Subscription filter** button in the top menu of the Azure Portal, and ensure that the Azure Active Directory for your Azure Subscription is selected. When previously configuring the **Northwind Traders Directory**, it will currently be selected, so you will need to click on the appropriate Directory for your Azure Subscription to change Directories and be able to continue with the tab.
