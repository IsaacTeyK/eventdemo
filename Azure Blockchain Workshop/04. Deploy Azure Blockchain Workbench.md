## Exercise 2: Deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench
Duration: 60 - 90 minutes

In this exercise, the student will deploy and setup Azure Blockchain App Builder.

### Task 1: Generate SSH Public / Private Key
1. Run **PuTTY Key Generator** **(puttygen.exe)**:
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>

2. Click **Generate** to begin generating a new public/private key pair, and follow the instructions to move the mouse to generate randomness

6. When prompted *"Are you sure you want to save this key without a passphrase to protect it?"*, click **Yes**. Normally, you would set a passphrase for better security of the Private Key, but for this Lab you can skip that.
