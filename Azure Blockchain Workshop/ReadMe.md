# Workshop
In this workshop, you will learn how to design a solution with Ethereum Blockchain adn several Azure services to collect device telemetry information and enforce contract specifics related to conditions during the transport of goods.

### Hands-on lab
In this lab, students will learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things (IoT) Audit Solution using Azure Blockchain. Students will do this using Ethereum Blockchain with the use of Smart Contracts to collect device telemetry information in addition to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be validated through the Smart COntracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

Student will learn how to:
* Deploy and Configure Azure Blockchain Workbench
* Write and Deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity
* Integrate both IoT and Blockchain together into a single solution
