8. Repeat the last couple steps to create the following additional users within Azure AD, and log in with them to the Blockchain Workbench Web Client so their accounts created

| -------------                |:-------------:|
| Contoso Shipping             |contososhipping@<your-azure-ad-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com |
| Blockchain Shipping          |blockchainshipping@<your-azure-ad-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com      |
| Simulated Device |simulateddevice@<your-azure-ad-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com  |
| Northwind Traders Supplychain| northwindtraderssupplychain@<your-azure-ad-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com      |
| Goverment Regulator          | governmentregulator@<your-azure-ad-tenant>.onmicrosoft.com  |

> NOTE: Be sure to record the passwords for each account so you can login with them later
