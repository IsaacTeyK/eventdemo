## Exercise 4: Create Smart Contract
Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a new Smart Contract that targets the Ethereum blockchain that is written in the Solidity programming language.

### Task 1: Code TelementryCompliance SmartContract
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**, click **File** followed by **Open Folder...**

4. Type in **TelemetryCompliance.sol** as the file name.
![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/eventdemo/blob/master/Azure%20Blockchain%20Workshop/Image/D4.png)

5. Open the **TelemetryCompliance.sol** file, then add the following line to the top of the file. This first line specifies the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.20 or newer that does not break functionality up to, but not including version 0.5.0. This is to ensure the Smart Contract does not behave differently with a new compiler version.
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;
```

6. Next, add the base contract for Blockchain Workbench, WorkbenchBase

When creating Smart Contracts, this base contract will capture the contract type and address, then log them as events. The type and address are passed into the base contract from the constructor, and the ContractCreated function is called from the constructor. As state changes, the contract will call the ContractUpdated function on the base contract to indicate an update has occured specifying the function in the contract that was called.
```
contract WorkbenchBase {
    event WorkbenchContractCreated(string applicationName, string workflowName, address originatingAddress);
    event WorkbenchContractUpdated(string applicationName, string workflowName, string action, address originatingAddress);

    string internal ApplicationName;
    string internal WorkflowName;

    function WorkbenchBase(string applicationName, string workflowName) internal {
        ApplicationName = applicationName;
        WorkflowName = workflowName;
    }

    function ContractCreated() internal {
        WorkbenchContractCreated(ApplicationName, WorkflowName, msg.sender);
    }

    function ContractUpdated(string action) internal {
        WorkbenchContractUpdated(ApplicationName, WorkflowName, action, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

7. Next, add the beginning of the Smart Contract. The type name for this contract will be TelemetryCompliance, and it will inherit from the WorkbenchBase base contract.
```
contract TelemetryCompliance is WorkbenchBase('TelemetryCompliance', 'TelemetryCompliance')
{
    // insert smart contract code here
}
```

8. Next, the functionality of the Smart Contract needs to be filled out. Start this by adding the following **enum StateType** definition within the **TelemetryCompliance** class.
```
enum StateType {
    Creating,
    Created,
    TransitionRequestPending,
    InTransit,
    FinalDelivery,
    Completed,
    OutOfCompliance
}
```

9. Add the **State** property of type **StateType**. This will be used through-out the lifetime of the Smart Contract to store the appropriate state of the contract.
```
StateType public State;
```

10. Add the following additional properties to the Smart Contract. These properties will be used to track the different individuals who will be participating in the workflow.
```
address public InitiatingCounterparty;
address public Counterparty;
address public PreviousCounterparty;
address public RequestedCounterparty;
address public Device;
address public SupplyChainOwner;
address public SupplyChainObserver;
```
The "**Counterparty**" properties that were added are used to reflect the different individuals' organizations that have had, do currently have, or are about to have possession of a package.

There is also a "**Device**" property to provide telemetry information on humidity and temperature which will evaluated by the Smart Contract. The contract is setup so that this can work with both a real device and Azure IoT Hub, or a person simulating the device as a logged in user.

The "**SupplyChainOwner**" represents the organization that is shipping the package through the supply chain.

The "**SupplyChainObeserver**" represents an organization that does not participate in the supply chain but may be monitoring it. An example of an observer could be a government agency.

**NOTE:** The SupplyChainObserver is included in the properties of the Smart Contract, but it's not being implemented in this lab.

11. Add the following properties to be used to enforce the package will be maintained in an environment with minimum and maximum threshold readings (min and max) for bot Temperature and Humidity. There are also properties that record the last reported values and the timestamp for the last sensor update; as a Unix epoch date value versus a formatted date and time.
```
int public MinHumidity;
int public MaxHumidity;
int public MinTemperature;
int public MaxTemperature;
int public LastHumidity;
int public LastTemperature;
uint public LastSensorUpdateTimestamp;
```

12. Next, add some properties to provide information on the compliance status of the contract. The **ComplianceStatus** property will store whether the monitored sensor values are out of compliance. The **enum SensorType** will be used along with the **ComplianceSensorType** property to store information on the specific sensor reading recorded. The **ComplianceSensorReading** property will store the actual value of the sensor reading. Also, the **ComplianceDetail** property will store additional information about the compliance.
```
enum SensorType { None, Humidity, Temperature }
bool public ComplianceStatus;
string public ComplianceDetail;
SensorType public ComplianceSensorType;
int public ComplianceSensorReading;
```

13. To start adding the functionality of Smart Contract, next, add the following **Constructor** to the **TelemetryCompliance** Smart Contract:
```
function TelemetryCompliance(address device, address supplyChainOwner, address supplyChainObserver, int minHumidity, int maxHumidity, int minTemperature, int maxTemperature) 
{
    ComplianceStatus = true;
    ComplianceSensorReading = -1;
    InitiatingCounterparty = msg.sender;
    Counterparty = InitiatingCounterparty;
    Device = device;
    SupplyChainOwner = supplyChainOwner;
    SupplyChainObserver = supplyChainObserver;
    MinHumidity = minHumidity;
    MaxHumidity = maxHumidity;
    MinTemperature = minTemperature;
    MaxTemperature = maxTemperature;
    State = StateType.Created;
    ContractCreated();
}
```
The constructor function has the same name as the Smart Contract and is called when the contract is created. The contract assumes the individual creating the contract is the **Counterpartu** and will also  assign this individual to the **InitiatingConterparty**.

Initially, the constructor set the **ComplianceStatus** to true for meeting compliance, and the **ComplianceSensorReading** to **-1** since no sensor readings have occured yet. It then sets the **State** to indicated it was just **Created**.

14. Next, add the **IngestTelemetry** fuction to the SmartContract. This function will receive the device telemetry information from sensors on the package. The parameters of this function are **humidity** and **temperature** to receive data from sensors, and the third is the **timestamp** parameter is an integer representing a Unix epoch time for when the sensor information was collected.

	The IngestTelemetry function performs the following actions:
    
    a. It verifies the sender of the telemetry is the Device that's assigned to the contract
    
    b. It confirms the contract is in a state where it is interested in receiving telemetry information; aka the contract State is not "Complicated" or "Out of Compliance"
    
    c. It assigns the values of their associated properties; LastHumidity, LastTemperature, and LastSensorUpdateTimestamp
    
    d. It checks the Temperature and Humidity telemetry values to identufy are out of established ranges when the contract was created. If telemetry is not within the min and max values, then the contract will be recorded as "Out of Compliance" by setting the ComplianceStatus property to false. It will also record which telemetry has caused the compliance issue.
    
    **NOTE**: The sensor data may be collected continuously, but data will not be sent to the contract continuously. Instead, it will be sent when business rules have identified that the data falls outside the acceptable ranges. Not reflected in the lab, is the scenario where information is also once per x, where x is a time interval such as 5 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, etc.
```
function IngestTelemetry(int humidity, int temperature, uint timestamp)
{
    if (Device != msg.sender || State == StateType.OutOfCompliance || State == StateType.Completed)
    {
        revert();
    }
    
    LastHumidity = humidity;
    LastTemperature = temperature;
    LastSensorUpdateTimestamp = timestamp;
    
    if (humidity > MaxHumidity || humidity < MinHumidity)
    {
        ComplianceSensorType = SensorType.Humidity;
        ComplianceSensorReading = humidity;
        ComplianceDetail = 'Humidity value out of range.';
        ComplianceStatus = false;
    }
    else if (temperature > MaxTemperature || temperature < MinTemperature)
    {
        ComplianceSensorType = SensorType.Temperature;
        ComplianceSensorReading = temperature;
        ComplianceDetail = 'Temperature value out of range.';
        ComplianceStatus = false;
    }

    if (ComplianceStatus == false)
    {
        State = StateType.OutOfCompliance;
        /*When updating state */
        ContractUpdated("IngestTelemetry");
    }
}
```
15. Add the **RequestTransferResponsiblity** function to the Smart Contract. This function will manage making requests for another party to take responsibility for an item. This function performs an evaluation whether the address associated with the request is the current *Counterparty*, and the contract is in a state where a transfer is possible.

	If the appropriate context is not in place, it will flag an error to the caller using the "revert()" method.
    
    If the appropriate context is in place, then it sets the *RequestedCounterparty* property to the value of the *newCounterparty* parameter.

```
function RequestTransferResponsibility( address newCounterparty )
{
    if (Counterparty != msg.sender || (State != StateType.Created && State != StateType.InTransit) || newCounterparty == Device || newCounterparty == SupplyChainObserver)
    {
        revert();
    }
    RequestedCounterparty = newCounterparty;
    State = StateType.TransitionRequestPending;
    /*When updating state */
    ContractUpdated("RequestTransferResponsibility");
}
```

16. Next, add the **AcceptTransferResponsibility** function.This function manages the process of the requested party to acknowledge a transfer of responsibility of an item. This function performs an evaluation whether the address associated with the request is the current *RequestedCounterparty*, and the contract is in a state *TransitionRequestPending*.

	If the appropriate context is not in place, it will flag an error to the caller using the *"recvert()"* method.
    
    If the appropriate context in place, it sets the *PreviousCounterparty* property to the value of the current *CounterParty* property. It then sets the current *Counterparty* to the *RequestedCounterparty* that has accepted the transfer of responsibility. It transitions the state to *"InTransit"* and resets the *RequestedCounterparty* to 0x0.
```
function AcceptTransferResponsibility()
{
    if (RequestedCounterparty != msg.sender || State != StateType.TransitionRequestPending)
    {
        revert();
    }

    PreviousCounterparty = Counterparty;
    Counterparty = RequestedCounterparty;
    RequestedCounterparty = 0x0;
    State = StateType.InTransit;
    /*When updating state */
    ContractUpdated("AcceptTransferResponsibility");
}
```
17. Add the **TakenFinalDelivery** function. This function is used to identify when the final delivery of the package has taken place. The function performs an evaluation to determine whether the address associated with the request to terminate the function is the current *Counterparty* and the package is in the state of *"InTransit"*

	In not, it will flag an error to the caller using the *"revert()"* method.
    
    If it is *Counterparty*, it then sets the state of teh contract, via the **State** property, to **FinalDelivery**.
```
function TakeFinalDelivery()
{
    if (Counterparty != msg.sender || State != StateType.InTransit)
    {
        revert();
    }

    State = StateType.FinalDelivery;
    /*When updating state */
    ContractUpdated("TakeFinalDelivery");
}
```

18. Add the **Complete** function. This function allows the **SupplyChainOwner** to sign off on the contract as beging complete when the contract is in the final delivery state. This function confirms that the caller is the *SupplyChainOwner* and that the *FinalDelivery* state.

	If not, it will flag an error to the caller using the *"revert()"* method.
    
    if it is, then it sets the State of the contract to *Completed*, sets the *PreviousCounterparty* property to the current value of the *Counterparty* property, and then resets the value of the current *Counterparty*.
```
function Complete()
{
    if (SupplyChainOwner != msg.sender || State != StateType.FinalDelivery)
    {
        revert();
    }

    PreviousCounterparty = Counterparty;
    Counterparty = 0x0;
    State = StateType.Completed;
    /*When updating state */
    ContractUpdated("Complete");
}
```
