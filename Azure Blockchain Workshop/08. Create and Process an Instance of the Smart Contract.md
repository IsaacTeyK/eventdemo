## Exercise 6: Create and Process an Instance of the Smart Contract
Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, the student will create a new instance of the TelemetryCompliance Smart Contract, and work through the workflow of the Supply Chain as programmed in the code of the Smart Contract. The student will also test the Compliance piece by simulating IoT Device Telemetry by logging in as the "Simulated Device" user.

### Task 1: Create Contract Instance
1. Open a new browser in Incognito or Private browser mode, and navigate to the **Blockchain Workbench Web Client URL**
>NOTE: Since you finish creating all the different users accounts, you need to make sure you log into the Blockchain App Builder web app with each login to setup each of the accounts in the Blockchain network. Also, since these accounts were just created you'll need to wait a couple minutes for that setup to fully finish processing within the Blockchain network before continuing with this task.

2. Login as the **woodgrovedistribution** user

    d. minHumidity: **80**
    
    e. maxHumidity: **90**
    
    f. minTemperature: **40**
    
    g. maxtemperature: **55**
