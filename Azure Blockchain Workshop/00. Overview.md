## Overview
## Abstract and learning objectives
Students will learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things (IoT) Audit Solution using Azure Blockchain. Students will do this using Ethereum Blockchain with the use of Smart Contracts to collect device telemetry information in addition to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be  validated through the Smart Contracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

Students will learn how to:
* Deploy and Configure Azure Blockchain Workbench
* Write and Deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity
* Integrate both IoT and Blockchain together into a single solution

## Review the customer case study
**Customer situation**

Northwind Traders is the world's largest food and beverage company. The company has a long history of innovation since its founding more than 150 years ago. Over the last few years, Northwind has been increasing their emphasis on tracking their products from the origin of the raw materials all way through the manufacturing process to the consumer. They pride themselves on being able to certify both the origin and delivery of their products with high accuracy.

With multiple shipping companies and methods, from trucks, to train, to ships, it is very difficult to guarantee traceability and accuracy of the shipping data. It is also very difficult to avoid inefficiencies and profit losses. The CEO of Northwind Traders, John Adams, states, "The solution to guaranteeing the quality of our products health is complete control of the supply chain."
