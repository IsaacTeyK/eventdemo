## Learning objectives
In this lab, students will learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things(IoT) Audit Solution using Azure Blockchain. Students will do this using Ethereum Blockchain with the use of Smart Contracts to collect device telemetry information in addition to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be validated through the Smart Contracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

Students will learn how to:
* Deploy and Configure Azure Blockchain Workbench
* Write and Deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity
* Integrate both Io and Blockchain together into a single solution

### Overview
In this lab, students will deploy a Blockchain solution using the Azure Blockchain Workbench. They will then configure authentication and authorization of multiple users using Azure AD. Then a Smart Contract to track and enforce compliance of a package in the Supply Chain will be implemented with the Blockchain written in Solidity. Finally, the student will create an instance of the Smart Contract on the Blockchain, go through the business workflow defined in the Smart Contract. The student will also feed IoT device sensor telemetry into the Blockchain Smart Contract to validate compliance of the contract using a simulated device account.
